## What This Means in Practice

- Before adding or updating dependencies, verify license compatibility against
  this allowlist.
- If dependency license metadata is ambiguous, treat it as unapproved until
  clarified.
- LGPL dependencies are allowed only if the LGPL-covered source is not modified
  in this project.
- If LGPL-covered source modifications are required, treat as non-compliant
  unless explicitly re-approved and documented before merge.
- If a dependency violates this rule, do not add it; propose a compliant
  alternative.
- If an existing dependency is found non-compliant, flag it immediately for
  remediation.

## Packaging

- Provide exactly one simple pip install that gets everything needed to develop
  and run tests (for example `pip install -e .` or `pip install
<this-package>`).
- Do not split runtime drivers or developer/test tooling into optional extras
  such as `[web]`, `[desktop]`, `[test]`, `[static]`, or `[docs]`. Put those
  packages in the main `dependencies` list in `pyproject.toml`.
- Platform- or Python-version environment markers on individual dependencies are
  fine when a package only applies on that platform.

## Testing

- Only write high value unit tests.
- Do not prioritize code coverage for the sake of coverage. Better coverage can
  be achieved by keeping the project small and maintainable.
- Static analysis does not need to apply to support scripts or tests. That level
  of meta-testing is not needed for this project.

## Code Quality

- Do not add anything beyond what was asked. No scaffolding, no-ops, exceptions,
  or stubs outside that scope. If the work needs a new system or a meaningful
  scope increase, ask first.
- Do not stub out planned features; that's pointless. This applies to code
  infrastructure, tests, exceptions, etc.
- Do not over-use helper functions or lambda functions. While they have a place,
  sometimes it's more clear to juse do a one-off operation in-line.
- Avoid magic numbers. Instead define a variable with a semantic meaning, or
  just place a comment above it.
- Do not overengineer. Not everything needs an entire supporting system.
  Minimizing the footprint of your code is paramount for human readability.
- Do not add fallback mechanisms for everything. Elaborate error handling is
  often unnecessary.

### Footprint

Follow the workspace **Minimizing footprint** section (top-level `AGENTS.md`).
Distill
requests before coding; search for existing helpers; prefer deletion and local
plugin
helpers over growing core. Do not cap static-analysis tool versions (use `>=`
only).
