# What This Means in Practice

- Before adding or updating dependencies, verify license compatibility against this allowlist.
- If dependency license metadata is ambiguous, treat it as unapproved until clarified.
- LGPL dependencies are allowed only if the LGPL-covered source is not modified in this project.
- If LGPL-covered source modifications are required, treat as non-compliant unless explicitly re-approved and documented before merge.
- If a dependency violates this rule, do not add it; propose a compliant alternative.
- If an existing dependency is found non-compliant, flag it immediately for remediation.


## Unit Testing

- Only write high value unit tests.
- Do not prioritize code coverage for the sake of coverage. Better coverage can be achieved by keeping the project small and maintainable.
