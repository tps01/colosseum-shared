# What This Means in Practice

- Before adding or updating dependencies, verify license compatibility against this allowlist.
- If dependency license metadata is ambiguous, treat it as unapproved until clarified.
- LGPL dependencies are allowed only if the LGPL-covered source is not modified in this project.
- If LGPL-covered source modifications are required, treat as non-compliant unless explicitly re-approved and documented before merge.
- If a dependency violates this rule, do not add it; propose a compliant alternative.
- If an existing dependency is found non-compliant, flag it immediately for remediation.


## Testing

- Only write high value unit tests.
- Do not prioritize code coverage for the sake of coverage. Better coverage can be achieved by keeping the project small and maintainable.
- Static analysis does not need to apply to support scripts or tests. That level of meta-testing is not needed for this project.


## Code Quality

- Do not stub out planned features; that's pointless. This applies to code infrastructure, tests, exceptions, etc.
- Do not over-use helper functions or lambda functions. While they have a place, sometimes it's more clear to juse do a one-off operation in-line.
- Avoid magic numbers. Instead define a variable with a semantic meaning, or just place a comment above it.
- Do not overengineer. Not everything needs an entire supporting system. Minimizing the footprint of your code is paramount for human readability.
